# Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è INSECURE - Public Read/Write

**IMPORTANT:** The current Firebase setup likely has public read/write access for development. This MUST be changed before production!

## Recommended Security Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    // Profiles - anyone can read, only owner can write
    "profiles": {
      "$address": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.address.toLowerCase() === $address.toLowerCase()"
      }
    },

    // Usernames - anyone can read, system can write
    "usernames": {
      ".read": true,
      "$username": {
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },

    // Player Matches - anyone can read, only owner can write
    "playerMatches": {
      "$address": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.address.toLowerCase() === $address.toLowerCase()"
      }
    },

    // PvP Rooms - participants can read/write, auto-deleted after 1 hour
    "rooms": {
      "$roomCode": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },

    // Matchmaking Queue - players can add/remove themselves
    "matchmaking": {
      "$address": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.address.toLowerCase() === $address.toLowerCase()"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Why These Rules?

### 1. Profiles
- **Read: Public** - Anyone can view profiles and leaderboard
- **Write: Owner Only** - Prevents cheating by editing other players' stats

### 2. Usernames
- **Read: Public** - Anyone can check username availability
- **Write: Authenticated** - Only logged-in users can claim usernames

### 3. Player Matches
- **Read: Public** - Match history is public (like on blockchain)
- **Write: Owner Only** - Only you can record your own matches

### 4. Rooms
- **Read: Public** - Players need to see room status
- **Write: Authenticated** - Any authenticated player can update room state
- **Note:** Should add auto-cleanup for rooms older than 1 hour

### 5. Matchmaking
- **Read: Public** - System needs to find waiting players
- **Write: Owner Only** - You can only add/remove yourself from queue

## Authentication Setup

Currently, the app uses wallet addresses as identity but Firebase doesn't have built-in wallet auth. You have two options:

### Option A: Firebase Custom Tokens (Recommended)
Create an API endpoint that verifies wallet signature and issues Firebase custom token:

```typescript
// app/api/auth/firebase/route.ts
import { getAuth } from 'firebase-admin/auth';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { address, signature, message } = await req.json();

  // Verify signature proves ownership of wallet
  const isValid = verifySignature(address, signature, message);

  if (isValid) {
    const customToken = await getAuth().createCustomToken(address, {
      address: address.toLowerCase()
    });
    return Response.json({ token: customToken });
  }

  return Response.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

### Option B: Temporary Public Access (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)
For development/testing only:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

## Anti-Cheat Measures

Even with security rules, clients can still cheat since they control the game logic. Consider:

1. **Server-Side Validation**
   - Move game logic to Cloud Functions
   - Validate card powers match on-chain metadata
   - Verify match results before recording

2. **On-Chain Verification**
   - Query Alchemy API to verify NFT ownership
   - Check actual card attributes from contract
   - Prevent fake card data

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limit matches per hour per player
   - Prevent spam attacks on Firebase

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Flag suspiciously high win rates
   - Detect impossible power levels
   - Alert admins to cheaters

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Firebase Admin SDK** (for custom tokens)
2. **Create auth endpoint** to issue tokens
3. **Update client** to get token before Firebase operations
4. **Apply security rules** in Firebase Console
5. **Test thoroughly** before deploying

## Current Risks Without Auth

‚ùå Players can edit other players' profiles
‚ùå Players can fake match results
‚ùå Players can manipulate leaderboard
‚ùå Players can spam database with fake data
‚ùå No way to ban cheaters

## Migration Plan

1. Deploy security rules gradually:
   - Start with read-only rules
   - Add write restrictions one collection at a time
   - Test after each change

2. Monitor Firebase Console for denied requests

3. Update app to handle auth errors gracefully
