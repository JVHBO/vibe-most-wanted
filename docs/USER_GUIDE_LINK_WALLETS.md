## What Gets Transferred When Merging?

- All your coins
- Your cards (NFTs stay in original wallet, but accessible from primary)
- Your stats are aggregated
- Raid deck is synced

## FAQ

**Q: Can I unlink a wallet later?**
A: Yes! Go to Settings and click the X next to any linked wallet.

**Q: What happens to my secondary account after merging?**
A: It becomes an empty shell - FID is removed, coins are transferred. You can still use that wallet for other things.

**Q: Do I need to own NFTs on my primary wallet?**
A: No! Cards from all linked wallets are accessible.
