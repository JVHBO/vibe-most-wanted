## 📈 RANKING BONUS SYSTEM

### Win Multipliers (Based on Rank Difference)

|----------------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **50+ ranks higher** | 2.0x | 100 | **200 coins** |
| **20-49 ranks higher** | 1.5x | 100 | **150 coins** |
| **10-19 ranks higher** | 1.3x | 100 | **130 coins** |
| **5-9 ranks higher** | 1.15x | 100 | **115 coins** |
| **< 5 ranks** | 1.0x | 100 | **100 coins** |

### Loss Penalty Reduction

| Rank Difference | Reduction | Base Loss | Final Loss |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **50+ ranks higher** | 60% | -20 | **-8 coins** |

| **10-19 ranks higher** | 35% | -20 | **-13 coins** |
| **5-9 ranks higher** | 20% | -20 | **-16 coins** |
| **< 5 ranks** | 0% | -20 | **-20 coins** |

**How it works:** Rank difference = Your Rank - Opponent Rank
- Example: You're rank #50, opponent is rank #3 → Difference = 47 ranks

- If you lose: -20 × 0.4 = -8 coins
